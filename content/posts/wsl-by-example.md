## How is WSL useful?

WSL is the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and I find it useful doing linuxy things, such as:

- ssh
- developing shell scripts
- running linuxy things like curl, base64, and openssl - sure, you CAN install and run them in Windows...
- incompatible toolchains - most notably, TUIs like `tig` don't run in Windows
- configuring neovim plugins for 17-19 hours every month (this is a joke, don't hurt me)

WSL2 is also well-isolated, such that I have already installed, deleted, reinstalled, and re-reinstalled distros, all without poisoning the Windows host. In other words, it's not ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»cygwinðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘».

## Installing

Installing is as simple as `wsl --install` if you're lucky; read this if you're not lucky: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install

Installing a specific distro happens through the Windows Store. I don't know why, either. Maybe forcing die-hard CLI advocates to install their favorite\* distro through the Windows Store is a kind of joke? Well, in any case it's hilarious.

As an aside, good luck with the Windows Store. It's somewhat buggy and opaque.

## Surprisingly useful WSL tips

To be clear, the following commands are run from `bash` in WSL, not from a Windows shell.

```bash
## launch Windows Explorer here
cmd.exe /c start .

## works on links too
cmd.exe /c start https://google.com/search?q=wsl+by+example+cheatsheet

## pipe directly to the Windows clipboard
echo "${WSL_DISTRO_NAME}" | clip.exe
```

## Accessing files

**From Windows:**

- `\\wsl$` - see all Distros
- `\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\p\.bashrc` - my bashrc (note everything after `\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04` is the Ubuntu filesystem)
- `cd \\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04` works in PowerShell, but DOS can't see it (not even via `net use`). And that's okay. DOS can slowly die and nobody will mourn. RIP DOS. RIP. But die already.

**From Linux:**

- Windows drives are mounted to `/mnt/<driveletter>`.
- `mount` shows WSL2's special mounts:
  ```bash
  > mount
  C:\ on /mnt/c type drvfs (rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,case=off)
  D:\ on /mnt/d type drvfs (rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,case=off)
  # ...
  # boring parts redacted
  # ...
  ```
- So, reference Windows files and paths, do something like e.g. `ls -al /mnt/c/Users/p/Desktop`.
- Windows paths from WSL are case-sensitive.

## wsl.exe usage

`wsl.exe` is useful for specific things, but I mostly launch WSL directly from Windows Terminal.

```powershell
# start default distro and launch shell
wsl

# list - useful if you installed both 'ubuntu' and 'ubuntu-20.04' - whoops - anyway if so, get rid of one
wsl --list

# shutdown - frees memory and (more useful) sometimes fixes my weird DNS issues
wsl --shutdown

# both   --exec   and   --   run a command
wsl --exec echo "I'm in unix! PowerShell version: $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion) (evaluated in PowerShell)"
wsl -- ls -al


# SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BELOW - PAY ATTENTION:

# this echoes back      WSL distro: Ubuntu-20.04
wsl -- echo "WSL distro: `${WSL_DISTRO_NAME}"

# this echoes back      WSL Distro: ${WSL_DISTRO_NAME}
wsl --exec echo "WSL Distro: `${WSL_DISTRO_NAME}"
```

## VS Code

VS Code (running in Windows) seamlessly edits files in WSL2. `code .` loads the current directory into VS Code.

## Accessing WSL From Windows Terminal

I launch the Ubuntu 20.04 shell with `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `2`. Windows Terminal is highly configurable, so your experience may vary.

You can (if desired) set WSL as the default Profile for Windows Terminal.

## WSL: Turning it off and on again

These are the Baby Bear, Mama Bear, and Papa Bear of WSL troubleshooting options. (We don't talk about the Reboot-Windows Bear.)

- `wsl --terminate Ubuntu-20.04`
- `wsl --shutdown`
- `get-service | ? { $_.displayname -like "*hyper*" -and $_.status -eq "Running" } | restart-service`
- reboot (sorry)

## WSL2 file operations are slower

Be aware. I usually don't notice.

## WSL2 uses RAM

- If you're running WSL on a Windows OS with only 16GB of RAM, consider upgrading to 32GB. With 16GB, you're likely using all your RAM and relying on swap.
- WSL2 appears as `Vmmem` in Task Manager. Ubuntu 20.04 on my machine is currently using just under 2GB of RAM.
- To check your available RAM, look at Performance->Memory in Task Manager.

## Line endings

This is a really boring topic, but if you need it, you need it.

Git for Windows is probably checking out files with CRLF line endings (the specifics are configurable and too boring to fully explain - go read https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings). For most of us, if you commit files in Windows, push to GitHub, and pull them down in WSL, the line endings are LF in Linux and CRLF in Windows, which is probably what you want. However, if you're manipulating/accessing files between Linux and Windows, consider several solutions:

- `dos2unix` to manually convert a file from LF to CRLF from inside WSL
- Manually load and change line endings in your text editor. E.g. in VS Code in the status bar, it will say LF or CRLF. You can change this by clicking on the LF (or CRLF) indicator in the status bar. Or change it by running `>Change End of Line Sequence` from the Command Palette.

More permanent, team-friendly fixes:

- via `.gitattributes` in specific repos, always checkout some file types (e.g. shell scripts) as LF
- via `.gitattributes` in specific repos, always checkout all files as LF

More permanent, isolated-to-your-computer fixes:

- via `git config --global core.autocrlf`
- via `git config --global core.eol`
