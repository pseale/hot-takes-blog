Welcome! I'm Peter, and I'm here to:

- get a load off my chest
- write some spicy ğŸŒ¶ğŸŒ¶ğŸŒ¶ hot takes
- have some fun
- make some jokes
- sometimes make a serious point
- but also bury that serious point in a nuclear-grade take

You're here to be:

- entertained
- enraged
- entertainraged and achieve edutainment

I don't take myself, my hot takes, or this blog too seriously. I'm in essence a crank with a blog, and I'm having fun with this.
