Welcome! I'm Peter, and I'm here to:

- get a load off my chest
- write some spicy 🌶🌶🌶 hot takes
- have some fun
- make some jokes
- sometimes make a serious point
- but also bury that serious point in a nuclear-grade take 💣

You're here to:

- learn something
- be entertained
- be enraged
- sample a Neopolitan-esque combination of all three flavors. Let's call this edu-tain-ragement. Edutainragement. Flows off the tongue.

I don't take myself, these hot takes, or this blog too seriously. Enjoy!
